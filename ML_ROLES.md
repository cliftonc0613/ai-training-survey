# AI/ML Roles

An **AI/ML role** (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning role) refers to a job position focused on developing, implementing, and maintaining artificial intelligence and machine learning systems. This encompasses both traditional AI approaches (rule-based systems, expert systems, symbolic AI) and modern machine learning techniques (neural networks, deep learning, statistical models).

## Key Differences: AI vs ML

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
- Broader field encompassing any technique that enables computers to mimic human intelligence
- Includes: expert systems, robotics, natural language processing, computer vision, planning systems
- Can use rule-based logic, search algorithms, or machine learning

**Machine Learning (ML)**
- Subset of AI focused on systems that learn from data
- Uses statistical methods to improve performance on tasks
- Includes: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning

**AI/ML roles often overlap** in practice, as modern AI systems heavily rely on ML techniques.
