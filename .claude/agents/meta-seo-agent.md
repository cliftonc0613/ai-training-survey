## Implementation Patterns

### Smart Mentions System
```javascript
const locations = [
  "Upstate South Carolina",
  "Greenville, SC", "Spartanburg, SC", "Anderson, SC",
  "Taylors, SC", "Greer, SC", "Travelers Rest, SC",
  "Mauldin, SC", "Fountain Inn, SC", "Simpsonville, SC",
  "Easley, SC", "Clemson, SC"
];

const mentionedLocations = locations.filter(location => 
  content.toLowerCase().includes(location.toLowerCase()) ||
  title.toLowerCase().includes(location.toLowerCase())
);

const mentions = mentionedLocations.map(location => ({
  "@type": "Place",
  "name": location.includes("South Carolina") ? location : `${location}, SC`
}));
```

### Geographic Meta Tags Pattern
```astro
geoRegion="US-SC"
geoPlacename="Upstate South Carolina"
geoPosition="34.8526;-82.3940"
icbm="34.8526, -82.3940"
```

### Social Media Optimization
```astro
twitterTitle={title.length > 60 ? title.substring(0, 60) + '...' : title}
twitterDescription={description.length > 200 ? description.substring(0, 200) + '...' : description}
ogLocale="en_US"
```
